Simple Summary
----------------

The blog's code is available under the MIT license, posts are available under the CC BY 4.0 license, and submodules have separate licensing in them (but are all OSS too).

The Full Story
--------------

All code in this repository (**except for** code in submodules, code that is embedded in blog posts, code describing the posts in ``src/posts/``, and images for those posts in ``src/images/``) is licensed per the terms of The MIT License included below.

All posts in this repository in ``src/posts/`` and images for those posts in ``src/images/`` are licensed per the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International available at `creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_.

Use of the Khan Academy brand has `separate restrictions under trademark law <https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202263034-Trademark-and-Brand-Usage-Policy>`_, that are not affected by this licensing. So please don't create a site that seems like its affiliated with Khan Academy.
