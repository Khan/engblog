This is a placeholder post to be replaced by Jordan's upcoming post shortly.

We were previously planning on posting fortnightly on Saturdays, but **we have decided instead to post fortnightly on Mondays**. This is because some article said that day was better for posting on social media *(weak reason)*, and because everyone will be around to debug issues if we post on Mondays *(strong reason)*.
