Our engineering team has grown a lot over the past couple of years, and we’re
delivering more product than ever before. It’s exhilarating. It’s also tricky.
Because scaling is hard. This is the first of a set of posts in which we’ll
talk about how we’re managing it at Khan Academy.

Like many engineering organizations experiencing rapid growth, we’ve used some
standard strategies for scaling over the past two years:

- Technology and architecture—leaner and cleaner
- Decision-making and communication—be open, keep it simple, repeat often
- People and organization—make sure the right person is in the right seat
- Process and tools—standard and common across the team

These are effective levers, and they’ve been helpful as we’ve grown from a small
engineering team to a not-so-small engineering team, moving ever faster and
delivering more and more. Stay tuned for more on how we’ve used them.

But today’s post is about what I believe may be the most critical aspect of
scaling, the one that really determines how fast and smooth a growth journey
will be—evolving your engineering principles so they support hyperscaling while
keeping your culture intact and your team vitally engaged.

Getting principles right has an accelerating effect on all other levers of
change as well as positive impact on growth and professional development
opportunities for engineers. It also results in a sustainable codebase, faster
velocity, and—most importantly—happy and productive engineers.

Khan Academy’s initial engineering principles were key to the success of our
early years as an organization. They reflected the nimbleness necessary in a
team bootstrapping a foundation for reaching the vast global community of
learners whose lives could be changed with free access to a world-class
education. Those initial principles were aimed at removing any barriers to
speed. They encouraged, for example, anyone to work on any of the code, anytime.
They were effective, and we grew in both impact and team size. We grew a lot. We
grew to a size that meant alignment with our original principles was slowing us
down. We became more likely to break things and to leave behind clutter in the
code. Architectural decisions were made implicitly and on the fly and were not
logged. Ultimately our pace of delivery slowed. That’s when we identified the
need to correct course and embarked on a journey of turning things around:  it
was time to reexamine our engineering principles.

We had to refocus on what it takes to build high quality and sustainable code
when there are 10 times as many engineers working on the product, when the
product has expanded to include test prep (we have over 50% of the market for
[SAT prep](https://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/high_school_and_beyond/2017/05/college_board_reports_score_gains_from_free_sat_practice.html))
and enabling [teachers and students in the classroom](https://www.latimes.com/socal/glendale-news-press/news/tn-gnp-me-gusd-khan-academy-learning-20190712-story.html).
And continue to publish more and more world-class content - now in more than 40
languages and across more than 370 courses.

Here are our [updated Khan Academy Engineering Principles.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQ-HTuH38L8sf4ZObfJNlESpzYIPAP6QFe30qOqE8DA/edit?usp=sharing)
A very thoughtful working group of Khan engineers, architects, and managers
focused on what would guide us best in this next phase of our journey. The
principles represent how we work together as a community focused on growing a
world-class engineering team that delivers on a mission to provide a free
world-class education to anyone, anywhere. We champion quality (sometimes we go
slow to go fast), we nurture every engineer (everyone learns and everyone
grows), and we collaborate compassionately (we work as an efficient team and we
treat each other with utmost respect). The principles remind us that the impact
we make on our community and on the world should be no less than spectacular.

I’m excited to share [our new engineering principles](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQ-HTuH38L8sf4ZObfJNlESpzYIPAP6QFe30qOqE8DA/edit?usp=sharing)
with you. Please read. We’ll continue to unpack them in coming posts. And, we’ll
talk more about how the new principles are guiding us through a re-architecture
journey and other key foundation strengthening initiatives.

yourself to, come join us—[we’re hiring](https://www.khanacademy.org/careers)!
